# This Wall Can  - Struan Wall

A simple site to practice React state changes, learn hooks & styled-components. This is an ongoing build where I intend to implement and trial various unique animations, as well as share a bit about myself. There will be an initial lack of CSS while practising with state changes. The images are also just for demonstration.
